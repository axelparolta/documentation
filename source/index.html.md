# Introduction

## What is Phore?

Phore is a digital privacy cryptocurrency with a focus on sustainable development and growth. Phore uses Proof of Stake and Masternodes to secure the network and provide for a deep level of privacy and security. Phore has relatively fast block times compared with Bitcoin and low transaction fees.

## History

Phore is a digital privacy cryptocurrency, an update and rebrand of KryptKoin (KTK) which was
pre-announced in May 2014, and whose distribution started on the 21st May 2014.
Kryptkoin was a non-premined coin, distributed equally to people who qualified for a stake. In
total, 500 stakes were distributed in 2 stages. Bonus KTK was given to those who held for 30
days. There was no ICO, and no dev premine. The developer received 1 stake, the same as
every other stakeholder received. Following launch, Kryptkoin quickly developed a large
following and introduced an online marketplace in 2015, which included Paypal integration
where digital items such as Wordpress themes and physical items such as clothes were both
listed and bought.
To facilitate new features, the existing code needed to be rewritten from scratch. This required
a swap from Kryptkoin to the new Phore.
A two-month window was given to existing KTK holders to swap their coins for new Phore on a
1:1 basis.

## Team

The coin has a strong and committed team:

* Phroshi - Lead Developer
* Julian - Core Developer
* Fish313 - Technical Support & Social Media Manager
* Toby - Customer Relations & Social Media Manager
* Shanto - Community Manager & Customer Relations
* Liray - Technical Support & Japanese Community Manager
* Ubermaster - Planning and Partnerships

We will hire more staff and developers to strengthen our team as the Phore expands and
evolves.

## Roadmap

Phore is a restless currency. The key challenge going forward is to introduce real-world use which attract everyday people. In order to achieve this, Phore will implement advanced features to clearly differentiate Phore from other privacy based digital currencies.
A number of these will add to the functionality and strategic integration of the online marketplace, which will be built on the current foundations of Phore. Governance will determine many of the goals going forward to keep the currency decentralized, but a decrease in Master node rewards per block is expected to decrease inflation.

## Short Term (Q3 - Q4, 2017)

* **Zerocoin Protocol** - Fixes a major weakness within most digital currencies. With
Zerocoin Protocol implemented within Phore, your purchases and transactions are
secure and no one is privy to your financial activity.
* **Masternode Governance** - Those with Masternodes would be given ‘yes’ or ‘no’ votes
    using commands built into Phore wallets. Decentralized governance will allow a cryptocurrency
    network to grow, and incorporate democratic procedures that will ensure the
    longevity of the project, leading to a truly decentralized management system.
* **Online Marketplace** - UI compatibility for all devices. 

## Medium Term (Q1, 2018)

* **Segregated Witness** - Allows the number of transactions per block on the Phore
blockchain to be increased. All signature data will be removed so that more transaction
data can be packed in.
* **Decentralized Micro Crowdfunding** - Part of the Online Marketplace. A decentralized
Kickstarter or Indiegogo platform, targeted at the 'side-hustle’ and micro-business
generation. This means that the individual, partnership, or small startup with a brilliant
invention or service can easily use the Phore platform to raise money, with much lower
fees than other traditional platforms. We will also act as escrow until the product is
received by the buyer.
* **Creation of the Phore Foundation** - Develop long-term e-commerce solutions,
investments, partnerships, and to promote the sustainability and longevity of Phore.

## Medium to Long Term (Q2-Q4, 2018)

* **Smart Contracts** - This will allow decentralized apps (dApps) to run on the Phore 
Page 5 of 6
blockchain. Payment channels, trustless prediction markets, and decentralized
exchanges are all things we expect to see.
* **iOS and Android apps** - Integrated wallets and online marketplace access. This will
unshackle Phore from use on laptops and desktops to make it a true mobile-friendly
platform.
* **Ledger and Trezor Support** - For long-term cold storage.
* **Phore Labs** - Incubator for Phore related projects to encourage development and
growth through the Phore blockchain

The Phore Foundation will invest in projects to help them reach market and then reinvest
profits in further projects. It is envisioned that ultimately 5-10% of the projects on the
marketplace will be taken up by Phore Lab projects.
The Phore Foundation will actively seek out projects to support. These will be sourced from
individuals, universities, start-ups, and cooperatives around the world who have the capacity
improve the lives of others. Investments will be made in the form of Phore currency, and
participants will sell exclusively through the Phore marketplace online for a fixed minimum
period before being allowed to sell their product locally offline.

## Long Term (Q4, 2018 and beyond)

* A.I. Bot creation - For trading support of Phore on exchanges.
* Phore Foundation Scholarships - Talented Coders will receive paid internships on
placements at Phore.
* Phore Foundation Charitable Donations - Phore will be donated to charitable causes as
voted by the Masternode Governance system.
* Further Partnerships - With industry-leading companies.
* Event Sponsorship - Sponsor Phore related events to promote Phore as a platform

# Masternodes

Masternodes play a pivotal role on the Phore blockchain, by providing various decentralized services; Instant transactions and Governance.
<br><br>
Anyone can run a masternode simply by holding 10,000 Phore as collateral in their wallet. And by doing so, you will receive block rewards for helping provide services to the network. The operators of masternodes can also vote on various budget and development proposals.

## Vultr VPS Server Guide

What you will need:

* Local computer windows 7-10
* Remote server – VPS [www.vultr.com/](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=7216049)
* PuTTY to configure and setup VPS
* 10,000 PHR

Register an account with Vultr. Once you’ve done that, can create your first server
<br><br>
<p align="center">
<a href="url"><img src="https://github.com/forming/slate/blob/master/source/images/vps_create_add_instance.png?raw=true" align="center" height="107" width="650" ></a>
</p>

<br><br>
Select server location, have multiple options to choose from. All are perfectly ok.

<br><br>

<p align="center">
<a href="url"><img src="https://github.com/forming/slate/blob/master/source/images/vps_create_select_location.png?raw=true" align="center" height="356" width="650" ></a>
</p>

<br><br>

Next server type: Select Ubuntu 16.4 x64

<br><br>

<p align="center">
<a href="url"><img src="https://github.com/forming/slate/blob/master/source/images/vps_create_select_os.png?raw=true" align="center" height="235" width="650" ></a>
</p>

<br><br>

Server size, select the $5/mo option

<br><br>

<p align="center">
<a href="url"><img src="https://github.com/forming/slate/blob/master/source/images/vps_create_select_server_size.png?raw=true" align="center" height="284" width="650" ></a>
</p>

<br><br>

You can setup a SSH key so you don’t need to use the password every time to login to the server. But
to keep things simple for the moment we are just going to use the standard password given after the
server is ready.
<br><br>
Last thing server hostname & label

<p align="center">
<a href="url"><img src="https://github.com/forming/slate/blob/master/source/images/vps_create_server_label.png?raw=true" align="center" height="128" width="650" ></a>
</p>

<br><br>

Next we’re going to install PuTTY while the server is being setup.
Download from here: [http://putty.org](http://putty.org)
<br><br>
Once you install that, back to our Vultr account to grab the login details.
Now open PuTTY to add the server

<p align="center">
<a href="url"><img src="https://github.com/forming/slate/blob/master/source/images/vps_create_putty_configuration.png?raw=true" align="center" height="352" width="550" ></a>
</p>

<br><br>

Enter the IP address in the Host Name, and enter the server name to Saved Sessions. Click save.
<br><br>
Click the open button. Now the console has opened, click yes.
<br><br>
<p align="center">
<a href="url"><img src="https://github.com/forming/slate/blob/master/source/images/vps_create_putty_security_alert.png?raw=true" align="center" height="347" width="550" ></a>
</p>

<br><br>

Then enter your server login details provided in your Vultr account.
<br><br>
Now you cannot ctrl+V to paste in the console. Either right click on mouse or shift+insert (sometimes
on keyboard it will just be INS key)
<br><br>
User: `root`
<br><br>
Password: when you paste it will **not** display. So don’t try and paste again. Just paste once and click
keyboard enter.
<br><br>
Now the first thing we are going to do are a few updates to the server and install the required
dependencies for the wallet to run…
<br><br>
Run these commands in order, one at a time:
<br><br>
`sudo apt-get update`
<br><br>
`sudo apt-get upgrade`
<br><br>
`sudo apt-get dist-upgrade`
<br><br>
`sudo apt-get install nano htop git`
<br><br>
`sudo apt-get install software-properties-common`
<br><br>
`sudo apt-get install build-essential libtool autotools-dev pkg-config libssl-dev`
<br><br>
`sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev`
<br><br>
`sudo apt-get install libminiupnpc-dev`
<br><br>
`sudo apt-get install autoconf`
<br><br>
`sudo apt-get install automake`
<br><br>
`sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin`
<br><br>
`sudo apt-get update`
<br><br>
`sudo apt-get install libdb4.8-dev libdb4.8++-dev`
<br><br>
Now we have server updated and all the dependencies installed we can move on to the next part
and that’s installing a firewall…
<br><br>
`apt-get install ufw`
<br><br>
`ufw allow ssh/tcp`
<br><br>
`ufw limit ssh/tcp`
<br><br>
`ufw allow 11771/tcp`
<br><br>
`ufw logging on`
<br><br>
`ufw enable`
<br><br>
Check your firewall status using the following command:
<br><br>
`ufw status`
<br><br>
Onto the next step, setting up a swap file… Again just follow each one in order:
<br><br>
`cd /var`
<br><br>
`sudo touch swap.img`
<br><br>
`sudo chmod 600 swap.img`
<br><br>
`sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/swap.img bs=1024k count=2000`
<br><br>
`mkswap /var/swap.img`
<br><br>
`sudo swapon /var/swap.img`
<br><br>
`sudo free`
<br><br>
`sudo echo "/var/swap.img none swap sw 0 0" >> /etc/fstab`
<br><br>
`cd`
<br><br>
`reboot`
<br><br>

After the reboot you will need to log back into the server. Once you login again, let’s install and
compile the Phore wallet…
<br><br>
`sudo git clone https://github.com/phoreproject/Phore.git`
<br><br>
`chmod +x Phore/autogen.sh`
<br><br>
`chmod +x Phore/share/genbuild.sh`
<br><br>
`chmod +x Phore/src/leveldb/build_detect_platform`
<br><br>
`cd Phore`
<br><br>
`sudo ./autogen.sh`
<br><br>
`sudo ./configure`
<br><br>
`sudo make`
<br><br>
`sudo make install`
<br><br>
`cd src`
<br><br>
`mv phored phore-cli phore-tx ~/`
<br><br>
`cd`
<br><br>
Now if you plan to setup multiple masternodes, we can go back to our Vultr account and create a
snapshot of the server we just setup. It will save us time, no requirement to compile again. Unless
we have a wallet update, then need to start from scratch again for any new MN’s and update the
ones already running.
<br><br>
If you only intend to run one MN, run this command to remove the Phore source files, as they are no
longer required.
<br><br>
`rm -rf Phore`
<br><br>
Let’s fire up the daemon on the server, it will give us an error about missing rpc password. We will
come back to this later.
<br><br>
`phored -daemon`
<br><br>
Next if you intend to run multiple masternodes we can create the snapshot. Skip this if only intend
to run one mastermode.
<br><br>
<p align="center">
<a href="url"><img src="https://github.com/forming/slate/blob/master/source/images/vps_create_add_snapshot.png?raw=true" align="center" height="338" width="450" ></a>
</p>

<br><br>
Click add snapshot and select the server from the dropdown and add a label. Click take snapshot
<br><br>
<p align="center">
<a href="url"><img src="https://github.com/forming/slate/blob/master/source/images/vps_create_take_snapshot.png?raw=true" align="center" height="144" width="400" ></a>
</p>

<br><br>
This will take a while, grab a cup of tea! :)
<br><br>
Once it’s finished we can continue…
<br><br>
<h3>Step 1</h3>

We can fire up the qt wallet on your local computer. Generate a new address
<br><br>
Enter a label and click Request payment button.
<br><br>
Copy the address
<br><br>
<p align="center">
<a href="url"><img src="https://github.com/forming/slate/blob/master/source/images/vps_create_create_mn_address.png?raw=true" align="center" height="282" width="400" ></a>
</p>

<br><br>
And now go to the send tab
<br><br>
Enter the copied address and send **exactly** 10,000 PHR. No more, no less in a single transaction. Wait
for it to confirm on the blockchain.
<br><br>
<p align="center">
<a href="url"><img src="https://github.com/forming/slate/blob/master/source/images/vps_create_send_to_mn.png?raw=true" align="center" height="295" width="400" ></a>
</p>

<br><br>
Now create a new .txt file on your computer, to store the date used for the masternode
<br><br>
Can use this format:
<br><br>
MN Label:
<br>
Collateral address:
<br>
Masternode Key:
<br>
Public IP:
<br>
MN conf line:
<br><br>
Go to the [**Tools** > **Debug Console**] and enter these commands below:
<br><br>
<h3>Step 2</h3>

`masternode genkey`
<br><br>
<p align="center">
<a href="url"><img src="https://github.com/forming/slate/blob/master/source/images/vps_create_generate_masternode_output.png?raw=true" align="center" height="215" width="650" ></a>
</p>

<br><br>
Copy that into into the .txt file. *Masternode Key*
<br><br>

<h3>Step 3</h3>

`masternode outputs`

<p align="center">
<a href="url"><img src="https://github.com/forming/slate/blob/master/source/images/vps_create_generate_masternode_output.png?raw=true" align="center" height="215" width="650" ></a>
</p>

<br><br>


Now we need to format the masternode config line:
<br><br>
`<Name of Masternode>` `<VPS IP address>:11771` `<Result of Step 2>` `<Result of Step 3>` `<The number after the long string in Step 3>`
<br><br>
Example how final line should look:
<br><br>
`phore-mn01 107.131.25.434:11771 88xrxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx7K 6b4c9xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx7ee23 0`
<br><br>

Can add this to the .txt file. *MN conf line*

<br><br>

Edit the local wallet masternode.conf file. **Tools** > **Open Masternode Configuration File**
<br><br>
Add the *MN conf line*, like the example below to the masternode.conf file. Save it, and close the file.
<br><br>
`phore-mn01 107.191.55.244:11771 88xrxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx7K 6b4c9xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx7ee23 0`
<br><br>

Now we need to edit the **phore.conf** file in the local wallet. [**Tools** > **Open Wallet Configuration File**]
<br><br>

rpcuser=`<long random username>`
<br>
rpcpassword=`<longer random password>`
<br>
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
<br>
listen=0
<br>
server=1
<br>
daemon=1
<br>
logtimestamps=1
<br>
maxconnections=256
<br><br>

Save it, close the file and **restart** the wallet.
<br><br>

Now back to PuTTY and we need to edit the phore.conf on the VPS server.
<br><br>
`cd`
<br><br>
`nano .phore/phore.conf`
<br><br>
Enter the following:

rpcuser=`<long random username>`
<br>
rpcpassword=`<longer random password>`
<br>
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
<br>
listen=1
<br>
server=1
<br>
daemon=1
<br>
logtimestamps=1
<br>
maxconnections=256
<br>
masternode=1
<br>
externalip=`<VPS IP address>`
<br>
bind=`<VPS IP address>`
<br>
masternodeaddr=`<VPS IP address>`:11771
<br>
masternodeprivkey=`Result of Step 1`

<br>
<p align="center">
<a href="url"><img src="https://github.com/forming/documentation/blob/master/source/images/vps_create_add_phore_conf.png?raw=true" align="center" height="324" width="450" ></a>
</p>

<br><br>

Press **ctrl+X**
<br>
Then **Y** to save, press enter to exit
<br><br>
Let’s fire up the daemon on the server:

`phored -daemon`

<br><br>

We need to let it fully sync, give it a couple of minutes and enter:
<br><br>
`phore-cli getinfo`

<br>

{
<br>
"version" : 1000000,
<br>
"protocolversion" : 70001,
<br>
"walletversion" : 61000,
<br>
"balance" : 0.00000000,
<br>
"obfuscation_balance" : 0.00000000,
<br>
*"blocks" : 9656*,
<br>
...
<br>

We’re looking at the **blocks**. You can check your local wallet to see the current block height. By
hovering over the tick.

<br>
<p align="center">
<a href="url"><img src="https://github.com/forming/documentation/blob/master/source/images/vps_create_current_block_check.png?raw=true" align="center" height="93" width="185" ></a>
</p>

<br><br>

Once your server has synced up, back to the local wallet and click the **Masternode** tab. You should
see your MN listed.
Click the masternode to highlight then
Click **Start alias** or **Start MISSING**. Then click yes in the popup.

<br>
<p align="center">
<a href="url"><img src="https://github.com/forming/documentation/blob/master/source/images/vps_create_masternodes_tab_actions.png?raw=true" align="center" height="68" width="500" ></a>
</p>

<br><br>

<br>
<p align="center">
<a href="url"><img src="https://github.com/forming/documentation/blob/master/source/images/vps_create_masternode_start_prompt.png?raw=true" align="center" height="255" width="500" ></a>
</p>

<br><br>


If you receive an error message, go to the debug console and enter:
<br><br>
`startmasternode alias false <mn-alias>`
<br><br>
`<mn-alias>` being what you setup previously in the masternode.conf. And is listed on the
Masternode tab.
<br><br>

<aside class="notice">
You may need to unlock the wallet
</aside>

<br><br>

If everything was setup correctly, after entering the command you will see something like this:
<br><br>


    {
    <br>
        "overall" : "Successfully started 1 masternodes, failed to start 0, total 1",
        <br>
        "detail" : {
        <br>
            "status" : {
            <br>
                "alias" : "phore-mn01",
                <br>
                "result" : "successful"
                <br>
            ...


You can now close the debug, and return the masternode tab and check the status:
<br>
<p align="center">
<a href="url"><img src="https://github.com/forming/documentation/blob/master/source/images/vps_create_enabled_mn_row.png?raw=true" align="center" height="182" width="500" ></a>
</p>

<br><br>

Check your Collateral is locked. First let’s enable coin control: [**Settings** > **Options** > **Wallet**]

<br>
<p align="center">
<a href="url"><img src="https://github.com/forming/documentation/blob/master/source/images/vsp_create_wallet_configuration.png?raw=true" align="center" height="230" width="350" ></a>
</p>

<br><br>

Then go back to the Send tab. And you have a new Inputs option:

<br>
<p align="center">
<a href="url"><img src="https://github.com/forming/documentation/blob/master/source/images/vps_create_send_inputs.png?raw=true" align="center" height="207" width="350" ></a>
</p>

<br><br>

If it’s not locked, right click and select **Lock Unspent**

<br>
<p align="center">
<a href="url"><img src="https://github.com/forming/documentation/blob/master/source/images/vps_create_locked_10000_phr.png?raw=true" align="center" height="34" width="300" ></a>
</p>

<br><br>

You now have Phore masternode setup!
<br>
Repeat for multiple masternodes, using a Vultr snapshot can save a lot of the setup time. Remember
each one requires a unique IP address.
<br><br>
And watch the rewards come in…

<br>
